# Britt Ann's Portfolio

Hey! My name is Britt Ann. I'm a pizza gobbling, fun having designer person! I enjoy working in the graphic design field because it allows me to do what I do best, which is be creative! I specialize in packaging design and branding; please do not contact me for motion projects because I suck at those. Hit me up with some ideas and I'll turn them into great pieces of art!
